<p>
	The #1 reason people don't overland, is that they have great excuses.  So put away all
	the excuses and simply Get Out.  Let's start small with a picnic.  This is a micro version of camping and helps you start assembling some of the essentials.  Here's a quick list to gather:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Walking shoes</li>
	<li>Hat</li>
	<li>Picnic blanket</li>
	<li>Water bottle</li>
	<li>Small cooler</li>
	<li>Baby wipes</li>
	<li>Sunglasses</li>
	<li>Sunscreen</li>
	<li>Small duffle bag or backpack</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Most of the items need no explaining, but a few are worth describing the reasons for.
</p>

<p>
	Assuming you drive a car, there are a few essentials you should always have in your car.  A <strong>blanket</strong> is useful if you break down in the winter and need to wait out until help arrives.  If you live in earthquake country like I do, we are also advised to be ready to spend a day or two stuck in our car near our work. <strong>Water</strong> is essential to life and without it, a simple waiting game can turn into a non-fun hunt to quench our thirst.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Walking shoes</strong> aren't just for exploring new towns or light hikes.  Sometimes in an emergency you have to hike out, and those 3 inch pumps or flip-flops are going to make a few miles walk into a very unpleasant trek.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Baby wipes</strong> are incredibly useful.  They make cleaning up really simple and they don't take up much space.
</p>

<p>
	Having these items scattered around your car is less than ideal, so putting them all in a <strong>small duffle</strong> or <strong>backpack</strong> keeps them from cluttering up your car and ensures you always have them.  It's also easy to transfer between cars.
