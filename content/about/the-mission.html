<p>
	<strong>We are Mission Oriented.</strong>  We don't create overbuilt overland rigs and then look for excuses to use them.  Instead, we focus on an experience such as camping for four days in Saline Valley, or a week-long trip exploring Utah's National Parks.

<p>
	Once we have defined the mission, we put together the best package of vehicle and equipment to ensure a great trip.
