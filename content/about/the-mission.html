<h1>The Mission</h1>

<p>
	We are Mission Oriented.  Meaning we don't create overbuilt overland rigs and then look for excuses to use them.  Instead, we focus on concrete experiences such as camping for four days in Saline Valley, or a week-long trip exploring Utah's National Parks.
</p>

<p>
	Once we have defined the mission, we put together the best package of vehicle and equipment to ensure a great trip.
