	Overlanding implies vehicle dependent travel and self-reliance.  At Overland Science we help you develop two critical skillsets:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Preparation</strong>: Making sure your vehicle is ready, and you have the proper supplies.</li>
	<li><strong>Knowledge</strong>: The ability to resolve problems as they arise.</li>
</ul>
