	It's easy to pay a mechanic fix your vehicle.  But what happens when your truck breaks down 50 miles from the nearest road?
</p>

<p>
	We help you learn the science behind your vehicle so you are in the best possible possition to:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoid modifications to your vehicle that lower the reliability (the #1 cause of breakdowns!)</li>
	<li>Understand any strange noises your vehicle makes off road, so you know if you can go on, or it's time to pull over.</li>
	<li>Make field repairs to get you back to town.</li>

</ul>

<p>
	Knowing the science behind your vehicle will also <strong>make you a more interesting person to talk to</strong> and ensure you are a valuable part of any overlanding group.
